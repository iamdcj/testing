# Testing JavaScript
This repository contains a bunch of examples and explanations around the common types of testing;

- **Unit** - these types of tests are designed to test small pieces of functionality in isolated - in modern JS applications these often map to modules/components and helper functions. Unit tests are usually the most common types of tests in JS applications.
- **Integration** - these types of tests are intended to test how modules work not in isolation, but when they're combined together to perform a specific to task.
- **Acceptance/End-to-End/Functional** - these tests are designed to test the functionality of an entire piece of an app, i.e. they test a particular workflow and determine if the flow is robust - a good example of this is a checkout process.
